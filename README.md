<p>This project was meant to create a base portal with user authentication using the MERN stack for future use as a template in other projects. While I followed parts 1 and 2 of the above tutorial pretty closely, I deviated quite a bit for the front end, since I did not want to use Redux for simple user authentication. Additionally, I fixed several small errors encountered in the tutorial, used environment variables, async/await instead of callbacks for functions, and hooks with functional components vs. the older class components listed in the tutorial.</p>
